## aka Denki Carbon

API and Backend to Calculate the Current Carbon Intensity of the Japanese Grid...roughly

## API Documentation
- Staging Docs at [docs-staging.denkicarbon.jp](docs-staging.denkicarbon.jp)
- Production Docs at [docs.denkicarbon.jp](docs.denkicarbon.jp)
- Docs also hosted on SwaggerHub at [https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/FraserTooth/DenkiCarbon/1](https://app.swaggerhub.com/apis/FraserTooth/DenkiCarbon/1)

## Work so far:

- Pipeline for Extracting and Formatting All Utility Data
- Combined and extensible endpoint using Flask routing
- Added Pytest Tests
- Implementation of the [Serverless](https://www.serverless.com/) deployment framework
- Basic Website Built @ [denkicarbon.jp](denkicarbon.jp) - [Repo](https://github.com/FraserTooth/japan_grid_carbon_api_website) 

## Planned Work:

- ~~Make carbon intensity value data available in the form of an API, based on averaging historic data~~
- Combine Weather Data and Historic Data with ML to make forecast about 'likely current intensity'
- ~~Allow historic query on intensity~~ DONE!
- Allow historic query on predictions
- ~~Incorporate all regions in Japan~~ DONE!
- ~~Build Good Documentation for the API~~ Now Written up in Swagger 2.0 Spec
- Add Good Documentation for the Code
- Solve the 'Pumped Storage' Problem üëá

### Local Setup
This project is aimed at UNIX runtimes, if you are on Windows, consider using [WSL2](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/wsl/compare-versions#whats-new-in-wsl-2) which works fine.

**Python Bits**
- Install Python3 to match the [current Google Cloud Functions Runtime](https://cloud.google.com/functions/docs/concepts/python-runtime)
  - I use Python 3.8, and I use [pyenv](https://github.com/pyenv/pyenv) to manage my local versions
- Consider using a [virtual environment](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/venv.html)
- Install Pip
- Install project dependancies


**Node Bits**
- Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/) and ensure `npm` is installed
- Run `cd cloud_functions/ && npm install` to install serverless and its dependancies

**Runtime Bits**
- Install the [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk)
- Setup your Google Account, following the [Serverless Google Cloud Functions Guide](https://www.serverless.com/framework/docs/providers/google/guide/credentials/)
  - Name the project `japan-grid-carbon-api-<environment>` (prod is currently just `japan-grid-carbon-api`)
  - Add a storage bucket called `scraper_data_<environmentName>`
  - Add the `BigQuery Admin` role and a role containing `cloudfunctions.functions.setIamPolicy` to your service account (in addition to the roles listed in the guide)
  - (Everything else should be automatically generated, but there are a couple gotchas in naming etc., ask in issues if you have any problems)
- Place your Google Account service key in the ROOT DIRECTORY OF YOUR TERMINAL RUNTIME `cd ~` named `./.gcloud/japan-grid-carbon-service-key-<environment>.json` to match `serverless.yml`
- Run `./local.sh api staging` to run the api function locally, and `./local.sh scrapers staging` to run the scraper function locally with hot-reload in staging
- Use cURL, Postman etc. and ping `http://localhost:8080/<etc>` to initiate the function

### Pumped Storage Problem

My initial assumption was that the Pumped Storage carbon intensity factor would be 0 gC02/kWh, like it is in the UK. This assumption was based in the idea that one would only 'charge' the pumped storage when there was renewable electricity available to charge it. Since, at least in the UK, renewable energy is considered 'spare' then all the 'spare power' goes into charging to storage.  
**However**, some digging showed that for the TEPCO region, from 2014-2020, for >2500 datapoints, pumped storage was 'charged' when there was _not_ enough renewable energy to fill it. The vast majority of these occasions were overnight (1AM - 5AM), where assumably the charging was done to ensure resiliance for the next day.  
This poses a challenge, we now know that the Electricity in Pumped storage is not carbon neutral. And in order to model the Carbon inside the pumped storage for a given hour, we will have to look at the historical behaviour of the asset and figure out how much non-renewable power has gone into storage.  
In the meantime, we can use a small average figure for the Carbon Intensity, but it would be good to get a more accurate result.
